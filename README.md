## Working On

### Working on 43
##### Ensure all views in the app display correctly on the smallest mobile device available, ‚ÄúiPhone SE‚Äù Emulate in Chrome Dev tools.
- To enhance the responsiveness of my project, I will incorporate a mobile-first design approach by utilizing viewport meta tags, media queries, and flexible layouts. Ensuring relative units, such as percentages and em, for widths and heights, and leverage Flexbox and CSS Grid for flexible layouts. Make images and media elements responsive with the max-width: 100% rule.

### Working on 44
##### Allow users to see the show and season of any episode in their favorites list.
- UI/UX change where i would create a different display for my extended information on each show, if i created a table i would be able to display information a little clearer.

### Working on 45
##### Group episodes related by season/show in the favorites.
- UI/UX change, similar to what i would do for #44.

### Working on 46
##### Implement the feature to remember the timestamp where the user stopped listening within a 10-second accuracy period of closing.
- I would change the way im calling API for each extended show details as it resets the progress for each one i click, i would rather have multiple states where i can save inforamtion and store them locally so that i can cycle back to them checking the ID of each show.

### Working on 47
#####  Implement the feature to remember and display the timestamp progress of any episode the user has started listening to.
- Similar to how i would impliment #46.

### Working on 48
##### Store user favorites in the [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com) database.
- More research and time / videos to fully understand how to use Supabase correctly.

### Working on 49
##### Implement automatic syncing of user favorites when logged in, ensuring that they share favorites between devices.
- More research and time / videos to fully understand how to utalize Supabase.

### Working on 50
##### Allow users to share their favorites as a publicly accessible URL.
- More research and time / videos to fully understand how to utalize URL sending, as far as i know i need a database to do so, i will look further into Supabase.
